## Axisymmetric coil winding surfaces for non-axisymmetric nuclear fusion devices

Code made for optimizing parameterized coil curves in a surface, using CurveCWSFourier (from https://github.com/joaopedrobiu6/simsopt/tree/jb/curvecwsfourier). All the obtained results can be found in the folder `results/`. 

Research work performed for the Bachelor in Engineering Physics @ Instituto de Plasmas e Fusão Nuclear
